    Hobbies:
      - bullet: I started playing guitar in 2021, refining my technique through my local church choir San Gregorio VII. Bridging music and technology, I specialize in using the ChordPro format for notation and actively contribute to the Canti Cristiani app (User:G3nny25). My academic curiosity led me to a university Mathematics course exploring generative music, plagiarism detection, and algorithmic composition.
