Some people told me that have a website is important so here I am.

I was born in Salerno in 2004, but I live in Battipaglia. Currently, I am a Computer Science student at the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/).

I am at the beginning of my career, so this page is a work in progress—just like me. I hope to write more here in the future as I build my skills.
